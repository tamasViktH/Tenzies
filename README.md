# ðŸŽ² Tenzies â€“ A React Dice Game

**Tenzies** is a fast and fun dice game where the goal is to roll until all dice match. Players can freeze individual dice between rolls to strategize and win in as few moves as possible.

This project was built using **React**, and it helped me deepen my understanding of component state, user interaction, and conditional rendering â€” all in a playful, game-based format.
